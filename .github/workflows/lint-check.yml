# This workflow enforces code quality standards by running ESLint checks
# on all Pull Requests targeting main or staging branches.
#
# It will:
# 1. Run on every PR to main/staging
# 2. Check all relevant files
# 3. Fail if there are any linting errors/warnings
# 4. Block PR merging until all lint issues are resolved
#
# The lint configuration is defined in the project's ESLint config files
