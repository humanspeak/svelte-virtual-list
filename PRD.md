    - Manages item virtualization
    - Handles item positioning

3. **Measurement Layer**

    - Calculates item heights
    - Manages height averaging
    - Optimizes performance

4. **Buffer Layer**
    - Pre-renders items
    - Manages smooth scrolling
    - Handles edge cases

### Infrastructure
