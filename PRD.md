- Status: **Completed**

### Phase 10: Infinite Scrolling (Next)

- Goal: Seamless load-on-demand when the user approaches the start/end of the list
- Target scenarios: chat history (prepend at top), feed/pagination (append at bottom), `bottomToTop` anchoring
- Status: **Planned**

Planned API (subject to refinement):

- Props
    - `nearEdgeThreshold?: number` (px) – default 200
    - `onReachStart?: () => Promise<void> | void` – invoked when within threshold of the start
    - `onReachEnd?: () => Promise<void> | void` – invoked when within threshold of the end
- Events (alternative to props)
    - `reached:start`, `reached:end`, `near:start`, `near:end`
- Behavior
    - Debounced invocation; no re-entrant calls while a previous load is in-flight
    - Preserve scroll anchor on prepend/append; no visible jumps (esp. `bottomToTop`)
    - Works with dynamic heights/reactive height manager

Acceptance criteria:

1. Appending at bottom triggers only once per threshold crossing; maintains position if user is not at the edge
2. Prepending at top in `bottomToTop` keeps the last item anchored (no jump)
3. Works across Chromium/Firefox/WebKit and mobile profiles
4. E2E tests cover both directions, both modes, and loading while scrolling

Test plan (E2E additions):

- `tests/infinite/append.spec.ts`: triggers `onReachEnd` and verifies items rendered + no jump
- `tests/infinite/prepend-bottomToTop.spec.ts`: triggers `onReachStart` with `mode='bottomToTop'` and validates anchor
- Perf guardrails similar to existing performance tests
